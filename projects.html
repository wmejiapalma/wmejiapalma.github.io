										<h2>Pokedoc</h2>
									</header>
									<div>
										<p>
											PokeDoc is a web application for the health care industry that connects patient and doctor within a practice. This application aimed to solve the problem of having to make phone calls to create appointments. Patients could request appointments while doctors could manage patient loads. Built with security in mind and dockerized for easy scalability. Used various techologies including but not limited to: React, Springboot, MongoDB, Flask (Python)

										<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/pokedoc/croppedUserHome.png" alt="" />
										</span>From this homepage, by cliking on the plus sign, the patient could make appointments with any doctor they choose</p>
										<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/pokedoc/croppedDoctorHome.png" alt="" />
										</span>Doctors could reject, confirm, and complete appointments with the pattients assigned to them</p>

										<h2>Livestream Screen Reader</h2>
									</header>
									<p>
										Wrote an application in Python using Pytesseract that pulled an image from a twitch livestream and reads the text on the screen using AI. Its intended purpose was to know what times where presented on the stream and see if a streamer had a good time for a speedrun.
									</p>
									<img src="images/streamscreen/ProccessedPhoto.png" alt="" data-position="center center" class="image fit" style="max-height: 25%; max-width: 25%;" />
									<p>
										Some of the screenshots from the extracted text
									</p>
									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/streamscreen/PhotoOutput.png" alt="" />
									</span>
									The program gives us the row of the text with the number and the time. This is useful for speedrunners to know if the time is good or not. Unfortantely limited by the quality of the stream and the abilities of the AI.

										<h2>Ecommerce API system</h2>
									</header>
									<p>
										Wrote an API in C# .net for an ecommerce system. This system allowed customers to create seller and buyer accounts to trade and sell items. This system had all the steps for the system including checkout, catalog and card services. This entire system was containerized and deployed in docker for easy scability and increased reliability. Also wrote scripts for a one click deployment

									<p>
										Here is some code from the project that showcases some of the Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations from just one of the 5 microservices. This is the checkout service where checkouts are created and completed/deleted.
